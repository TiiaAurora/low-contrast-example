# Low Contrast Example

This is a Svelte kit website that shows an easy implementation of a low contrast mode to support accessibility for users with epilepsy and migraines. 

The project goes along with the blog article: https://blog.tiia.rocks/web-apps-why-offering-a-low-contrast-mode-makes-you-more-accessible-not-less

The site is live on: https://low-contrast-example.netlify.app/ and can be tested there.
